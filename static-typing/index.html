        <h3>Why typescript</h3>
<p>Recently, I changed my main  work environment in  browser from <em>coffeescript</em> to <em>typescript</em>.
Here I am to tell why. And about my  work environment.</p>
<h4>Coffee advatages over typescript</h4>
<ul>
<li>Lots of syntax sugar (Code in coffeescript is generally 30% shorter than typescript)</li>
<li>Indentation based folding</li>
<li>... That's it</li>
</ul>
<h4>Typescript advantages over Coffee</h4>
<ul>
<li>Clear output. Principle is  simple. Just strip typedeclarations and you Do get clean javascript</li>
<li>They intend to support es6(Coffeescript just does not bother about it)</li>
<li>Tooling</li>
<li>Module system (it is also a great disadvantage, see below)</li>
<li>Typesystem. nuff said</li>
</ul>
<h3>Library support</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/borisyankov/DefinitelyTyped">DefinitelyTyped</a> is a very good repository for many js libraries.
And if You do not have particular library there, you can just write it yourself.
As I have written it for <a href="http://complete-ly.appspot.com/">completely</a> just in <em>5</em> minutes.
<code>// Type definitions for complete.ly
// Project: http://complete-ly.appspot.com/
// Definitions by: VbifRkbvjd &lt;https://github.com/VbifRkbvjd&gt;
// Definitions: https://github.com/borisyankov/DefinitelyTyped
declare module completelyInterfaces {
    interface ICompletely {
        (el:HTMLElement,style?:any):IcompletelyInstance
    }
    interface IcompletelyInstance {
        options:string[]
        startFrom:number
        setText(data:string):void
        getText():string
        onChange:(data:string)=&gt;void
        repaint():void
        hideDropDown():void
        wrapper:HTMLElement
        prompt:HTMLElement
        input:HTMLInputElement
        hint:HTMLInputElement
        dropDown:HTMLElement
    }
}
declare var completely: completelyInterfaces.ICompletel</code>
You see that this is pretty straightforward. And, sometimes, might work as library documentation too.</p>
<h4>My work environment regarding typescript.</h4>
<p>It is strange to not to use IDE capabilities in a static typed language.
IDE like support in emacs is quite good via <a href="https://github.com/aki2o/emacs-tss">emacs-tss</a>. But it has two  disadvantages.</p>
<ol>
<li>flymake is deprecated (and checking is done via it).</li>
<li>As a consequence of 1. any large enough file hangs</li>
</ol>
<p>I tried to remove flymake from emacs-tss, and replace it with flycheck.
But it seems that emacs-tss is heavily depend on flymake, and doing so will require major refactoring of this mode.</p>
<p>So I decided to switch from <em>emacs</em> to <em>Intellij Idea</em>. It has quite good support for typescript. But it also has <em>two disadvantages</em></p>
<ol>
<li>Program correctness checking is weird.<ul>
<li>It, sometimes, show error, when compiler compiles</li>
<li>It, sometimes, does not show error, although compiler points that error.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>IDEA  hangs on React. Whenever  you type <em>React</em> in your <em>ts</em> file, IDEA  hangs, until you remove <em>React</em> from your file.</li>
</ol>
<h4>What I dislike about typescript</h4>
<p>The one thing, that is <em>definitely wrong</em> in typescript is <em>module system</em>.</p>
<p>There are two concepts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Internal modules</li>
<li>External modules</li>
</ul>
<p>The difference between them is that <em>external  modules</em> are about to work with <em>require.js</em> or <em>browserify</em>,
when <em>internal modules</em> are about to glue your js files into one.
You cannot use internal and external modules  at the same time.
And there are more intricate delicacies, like, you cannot glue module from different files if you use external system. And You can if you use internal.
So, for this I was going to kill someone, untill I made a hack solution</p>
<h4>Hack solution(No young and sensitive coders allowed)</h4>
<p>Here is the schema I came, when I bump my head enough.
Assume that I am working  in <em>node-webkit</em>. So here it is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dependencies:   <em>deps.js</em></li>
<li>Compiler-ouput(one file compiled with internal module system):                    <em>SomeSystemGlued.js</em></li>
</ul>
<p>And <em>deps.js</em> contain something like:
<code>window.Q = require("q")
window.R = React // because of "love" idea has to React(hangs)
window.NWGUI = require("nw.gui")
window._     = require("lodash")
window.path  = require("path")
window.fs    = require("fs-extra")
// e.t.c</code>
And then, every subsystem just use these from related <em>d.ts</em> files. As they are just  globals.</p>

        <h3>My evolution from dynamic to static typing.</h3>
<p>I have been "dynamic" for the most of my career in programming(Which is not a lot,for about 3 years of actual development in python and js.)</p>
<p>Being dynamic was not because of some conscious decision.</p>
<p>Just, when you start programming(having no CS background) dynamic typing seems less mundane, and more appealing for someone outside of development.</p>
<p>Now, nearly a month ago I switched my preferences to static typing languages, and here I am to explain why.</p>
<p>During my work, I found out,and, I sure, most of software engineers do, that  programming mostly
is not about crunching numbers,  but about connection in general.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I would formulate this software development principle  as knowledge about connection and composition.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<h4>Let me elaborate.</h4>
<p>When You are writing a new program it is about 80% of connection other people code in a new way than about writing some genuinely new code.
So that is why, program language  matter less than  having good  libraries for any possible case.</p>
<p>This principle directly applies to static typing.
Because static  typing <em>is</em>  about  connecting things. And compiler will tell you, if you connected them wrong.
For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is not about withdraw(account_id:number,sum:number).</li>
<li>It is about withdraw(account:Account,sum:MoneyManager).</li>
</ul>
<p>In the second case, you defined what Account is, and what MoneyManager is.</p>
<p>And withdraw will only work on accounts, and MoneyManagers.</p>
<p>So, when You forgot, what is withdraw about, You can always look at signature, look at definition of account and sum.
It allows you to write deeper programs, you are not restricted in connecting things just by numbers and strings. 
And you will never mistake pipes. And if you will, compiler will tell you about it.
I deliberately do not mention obvious:</p>
<ul>
<li>IDE support</li>
<li>ease of understanding</li>
<li>speed of compiled program</li>
</ul>
<p>Because everybody already knows that.</p>
